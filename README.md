# Launch-countdown-timer

This is a solo project started on the 18th of February 2021. I chose the ["launch-countdown-timer"](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-) exercise on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website. The website provided me with various assets including JPG images of the design files and a basic style guide. There's also a README to help me get started.

## Rules:

Your challenge is to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## The result expected:

Desktop:

Mobile:

## My method

I chose to use Sass and I am going for a mobile-first approach.
